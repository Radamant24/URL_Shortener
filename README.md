# MongoDB example app
This app connects to a MongoDB database, creates a collection, populates it with items, then drops the collection and closes the connection.

The steps are written to the page using Express.

It's based on the [nodeSimpleExample.js example](https://github.com/mongolab/mongodb-driver-examples/blob/master/nodejs/nodeSimpleExample.js).

## Getting Started
Sign up for a a free hosted mongodb instance at [mLab](https://mlab.com), then update `.env` with your database credentials.
